lua-voce
========

Lua bindings for the [Voce speech interaction wrapper/library][voce]
(friendly fork with updates to Voce [maintained here][ghvoce])

University's Virtual Reality Applications Center. Original author: [Ryan

Compatibility
-------------


Dependencies
------------
- Git, for downloading the source code and its dependencies.

- CMake 2.8.4 or newer, for building the source only. (not needed once
compiled and installed)

- Lua 5.1 (on Windows, the Lua Binaries project offers libraries and
executables for a variety of compilers)

- Luabind - [Ryan Pavlik's fork][luabind] with a CMake-based build and
other improvements is recommended.

Getting the Source
------------------
###The quick version:
    git clone https://github.com/vance-group/lua-voce.git
    cd lua-voce
    git submodule update --init

###A bit of explanation
The git repository hosted at the [homepage][home] contains the source
for the bindings, and in "git submodules" the source of tested versions
of Voce. If you forget to
run the `git submodule update --init` command, these bundled
dependencies won't be downloaded, and you'll get an error message when
running CMake as a reminder.

Building
--------
Just run CMake, being sure to set a build directory that is different
from your source directory. Tell it where to find any dependencies it
can't locate. Then, build the generated project/makefiles in the binary
directory.

The Voce libraries are configured and built in the same solution 
as the binding itself automatically.
